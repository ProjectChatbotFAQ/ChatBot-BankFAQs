      "You will be prompted for online registration for Verified by Visa/ MasterCard SecureCode through a pop-up screen. You will need to authenticate yourself with your Credit/Debit Card number, Card expiry date and ATM PIN (or CVV2 and Date of birth for Credit Cards, along with your mobile number and email ID). For Debit Cards, you can choose your password to be used for Verified by Visa/ MasterCard SecureCode. For Credit Cards, a One Time Password one will be sent to your email ID instantly, which has to be used to complete the registration process. Thereafter, you can continue shopping on the merchant website. If you decide not to register immediately and cancel the pop-up screen, your transaction will not get authorized and you would not be able to complete the transaction on such websites. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you don’t cancel the pop-up screen and register for Verified by Visa/ MasterCard SecureCode as it protects you from online frauds. View more"

Enter your HDFC Bank Debit/ Credit Card number and the online store will connect with HDFC Bank to check whether your Card is secured with Verified by Visa/ MasterCard SecureCode. HDFC Bank initiates a Verified by Visa/ MasterCard SecureCode pop-up window on your computer screen that includes your Personal Assurance Message (PAM) or Personal Greeting message.

      "A large part of the success of Mutual Funds is also the advantages they offer in terms of diversification, professional management and liquidity. Power of Compounding: The longer the period of your investment, the more wealth you can accumulate because of the power of compounding. That’s why it makes sense to start investing early. Quite simply, the incremental returns that you earn on your principal, plus accrued gains, is compounded. Rupee Cost Averaging: Most investors want to buy stocks when the prices are low and sell them when the prices are high. But timing the market is time consuming and risky. A more successful investment strategy is to adopt a method called Rupee Cost Averaging. By investing in an SIP you end up buying more units when the price is low and less when the price is high. To set up an SIP, walk in to your nearest HDFC Bank branch or invest through an Investment Services Account. View more"

This scenario has created volatility in the markets and uncertainty of future outlook. The prudent way to invest in this scenario is to benefit from the volatility and this can be done by investing through SIP’s. A monthly SIP helps in averaging out the cost of purchase and benefit from the power of compounding. It also helps in creating wealth over a longer time period. The current investment scenario is still dominated by negative sentiment. This creates volatility in the markets due to confused minds of the investors. Such volatility makes it difficult to capture the market movements and most people end up losing money with the intention of timing the markets. Also investing a lump sum in one shot might lead you to miss out on market opportunities. The tool to beat such a scenario is investing through a Systematic Investment Plan."
